# Excercise 1: Design Finite State Machine for button behavior


# Excercise 2: Design Finite State Machine detect "10110"
## Requirement:
- Repeatedly reading input character including '1' and '0'
- Print out a notice to notify when receive a full string "10110" 
- After receiving full string, system return to init state to be ready to receive next character
- Design Finite State Machine and Flowchart for detecting string "10110"
