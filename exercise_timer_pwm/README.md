# Exercise 1: Using HAL TIMER Library of STM32F4 to generate 1 Hz wave to control RGB led to turn on/off.  
## Requirement:
- Pressing the button will change the status of the led: double click to change led color, hold more tahn 3s to turn off. When led off, 1 click will turn on led. 
- Debouncing a button with interrupt. Debounce time is 50ms.
- Using **HAL TIMER Library** of STM32F4 to generate 1 Hz wave to control led.
