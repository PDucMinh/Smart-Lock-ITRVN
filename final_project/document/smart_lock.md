## Technologies

* **STM32 Microcontroller**: This project is based on the STM32 microcontroller platform, which offers a wide range of microcontrollers with different performance levels and features.
*  **STM32CubeIDE**: This project was developed using popular IDEs which is STM32CubeIDE, provide tools for code development, debugging, and firmware deployment.
*  **Communication**: This project includes ways to communicate between MCU and modules: UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, GPIO.
*  **Peripheral Libraries**: The project utilizes peripheral libraries provided by the microcontroller manufacturer or third-party libraries to simplify the integration and configuration of peripherals.
*  **Other Device**: We intergrated a lot of device to increase experiment of customer and performance of device .

## Features

The Smart Door Lock project includes the following features:
1. **Unlock by entering password**: Users are able to enter password to unlock the door
2. **Unlock by scanning card**: Users can also swipe their card to unlock it instead of entering a password
3. **Record time**: The system can record the status of the door in real time, and then displayed on GUI
4. **Admin rights**: Admin can unlock all doors, monitor the system, and reset passwords
5. **Users rights**: Users can open the door with password or RFID tag, set up new password and view history of door status
